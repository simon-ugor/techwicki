This is a brief list and explanation of all important features added to Instagram until now. This will be required to understand IG algorithm and not mix up any terms."
                    subheading2="Posts"
                    text2="Instagram posts were introduced in the very beginning, in fact, app was already released with this feature and I would consider this as a main feature of the app. Starting off with a simplest form of 1:1 aspect ratio square images, Instagram posts have evolved over time. As of right now, there are multiple types of posts users can choose from. Users can post an image not anymore required to be a square, video with a length restriction of 1 minute or a carousel containing up to 10 images or videos. Every post can include a caption limited with the length of 2200 characters, hashtags (maximum 30 hashtags per post), tags to tag other IG users on the post and location. There are also multiple interactions users can perform on a post. Post can be liked, commented on, shared or saved. These are the 4 main actions that will matter a lot when talking about Instagram algorithm."
                    subheading3="Stories"
                    text3="Instagram Stories were launched in August 2016 and now more than 500 million Instagrammers use stories daily. Stories are basically photos and videos that vanish after 24 hours. They appear in a bar at the top of the feed and when there is some- thing new to see, profile photo of the account will have a colorful ring around it, meaning there is a new story added from this account. The maximum length for an Instagram Story video is 15 seconds. As already mentioned other users can view these stories and also interact with them by replying to a story by using Instagram Direct."
                    subheading4="Instagram Direct"
                    text4="IG Direct is a private messaging feature on the platform. It allows users to share plain text messages, photos or videos from user device’s library, disappearing pho- tos or videos users take through Instagram app, Instagram profiles, Instagram photo or video posts, Instagram hashtags or locations. Instagram Direct was launched in December 2013. Before this feature, if user wanted to contact another user on IG, only possibility was to comment on one of their photos or tagging them in a comment on another photo."
                    subheading5="IGTV"
                    text5="IGTV or Instagram TV was released in June 2018 and opens up better options for influencers. IGTV is a solution for users who want to post videos longer than one minute. While video posts are required to be maximum one minute long, on the other hand IGTV videos have to be at least one minute long. Maximum length for video on IGTV is 15 minutes when uploading from a mobile device and 60 minutes when uploading from the web. Videos must be in MP4 file format. Users can upload a vertical video with an aspect ratio of 9:16 or a horizontal video with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Ways users can interact with IGTV videos are pretty much same as they can do on posts. Possibilities are to like, comment, share or save IGTV video."
                    subheading6="Instagram Reels"
                    text6="Instagram Reels is the most recent feature added to Instagram. It is a new way to record 15 to 30-second clips with music on IG. Although this is not officially stated, Instagram Reels has a lot of similarities with TikTok, a video-sharing social network- ing service which is lately becoming really popular. Some are also labeling Reels feature as a TikTok clone and it could be considered as a direct response to the growing popularity of TikTok. Users can share their Reels video to Stories, Explore Feed (posts) and the new Reels tab on user’s profile. When creating a Reels, user can either choose to film video clips on the spot or upload them from camera roll. Similarly to posts or IGTV, interactions available for users are to like, comment, share or save a Reel. Because of the Reels algorithm not being locked down yet, some users may be experiencing their videos to “blow up” (slang term for becoming famous or successful usually within a small amount of time). Some Reels may have a “Featured” label above the caption. Featured reels are a selection of public Reels chosen by Instagram to help users discover original content meant to entertain or inspire."
