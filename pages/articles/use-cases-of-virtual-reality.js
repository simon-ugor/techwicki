                    text="Let’s start from the very top and slowly make it down to the most specific use-cases. First division I would like to make, is differentiating VR into two main groups – VR aimed towards entertainment purposes and VR aimed towards educational, research or service-providing pur- poses. Main purpose for this division is, that I feel like VR is mostly known from the gaming branch thanks to all the advertising from huge companies. On the other hand, VR is underrated in branches like education, research or any other services being provided with help of VR."
                    subheading2="Virtual Reality aimed towards entertainment purposes (VR gaming)"
                    text2="VR gaming is the term used to describe a new generation of computer games with Virtual Reality technology that gives players truly immersive, first-person perspec- tive of game action. Participants both experience and influence the game environ- ment through a variety of VR gaming devices and accessories, including VR head- sets, sensor-equipped gloves, hand controllers and more. There is multiple possi- bilities how to play these games – standalone systems (Oculus), game consoles (PS4) or using advanced laptops and PCs. The best VR headsets for gaming in 2020 and 2021 are considered to be Oculus Quest 2 (standalone VR), Valve Index (PC VR), Sony PlayStation VR (PS4), HP Reverb G2 (PC VR) and HTC Vive Cos- mos. Best Virtual Reality games of the year 2020 are considered to be Trover Saves the Universe from Squanch Games founded by Justin Roiland (the co-creator of Rick & Morty), Star Wars: Squadrons, Half-Life: Alyx or No Man’s Sky. Of course, this was just a brief overview of what VR gaming branch brings to us. There is a lot more content to choose from and definitely even more to come. Not trying to dis- credit entertainment as a form of “health-improving” method, entertainment is can be a big part of our mental health. But VR has definitely more to offer in other branches too."

                    text3="This branch I would consider as more formal but definitely less-known. As I stated before, the fact this branch can look underrated and unknown by public is mostly because there is not as many huge companies advertising research and education in general, as there are many promotional campaigns for games and entertainment. Here comes to place second division of VR use-cases."
